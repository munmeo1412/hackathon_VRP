# hackathon_VRP
Last week, I join very first Hackathon competition within Technical team in my companny. 

My team project is to solve VRP (Vehicle Routing Problem)

This part of code is just my part for Auto Assign algorithm using KMeans Clustering and using priority (based on distance to warehouse, weight, deadline pick/deliver of each order) to arrange orders in routing.

I mainly used Python for this algorithm.
Although not got high prize, but the algorithm and result made me satisfied with my first Hackathon experience.
